# Microservices-Learnings
This repository contains several mini-projects that I have built to set up and demonstrate various components of a microservices architecture, including:

Config Server: A centralized configuration server to manage and provide configurations to microservices.
Zipkin Server: A server for distributed tracing using Zipkin to trace the requests across multiple microservices.
Admin Server: A server for monitoring and managing microservices using Spring Boot Admin.
Service Registry (Eureka Server): A service registry for registering and discovering microservices.
Load Balancing: A sample project demonstrating load balancing by following the API-Gateway architecture pattern.
Each mini-project is designed to showcase the functionality of these individual components in a microservices-based architecture.
